  <title>Display Lateral Tolerances</title>
  <shortdesc>Lateral tolerance
 represents a value that the amount a measured distance can vary. You can
 control the degree of accuracy needed
 for a future by specifying tolerances in manufacturing. A feature is some aspect of a part,
 such as a line, axis,
 point, or surface.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>You can append tolerances to the dimension
 text directly. These
 dimension tolerances indicate
 the largest and smallest permissible size. You can
 also apply geometric tolerances to indicate deviations of form, profile, location,
 orientation, and runout.</p>
    <p>You can specify exact
 measurements for lateral
 tolerances theoretically. They
 are called basic dimensions and have a boxdrawn
 around them.</p>

 Deviation tolerances represent the
 plus and minus values that are appended to the dimension values. If the deviation
 tolerances are equal, the Â± signs precede them and they are known as
 symmetrical. Otherwise, the plus value locates
 above the minus value. Shown
 in the following figures.</p>
    <p>If you apply
 the tolerance as a limit, ZWCAD calculates a maximum and minimum value using the positive and negative values provided. These values
 replace the original dimension values. The upper tolerance locates above the lower if you specify deviation
 tolerances.</p>

 The vertical placement of tolerance
 values that is relative to the main dimension text can be specified. For example, you can align the tolerances with the top, middle,
 or bottomof the dimension text.</p>
    <p>You can also control how to suppress
 zero for tolerance values, as you can with the primary
 and alternate units. The effect of suppressing zero in
 lateral tolerance is the same as suppressing zero in the primary and alternate units.</p>
