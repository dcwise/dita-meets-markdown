  <title>Set Text Height</title>
  <shortdesc>Text height is
 the size of characters, which is measured in drawing unit. With the same height
 setting, the displaying height of the
 TrueType font is usually lower than the one of SHX font. When the font is not of TrueType font, the value
 represents the size of the uppercase letters.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>When the text
 height is set to 0 in the text style, the system prompts you to type a height
 value while creating single-line text each time. So you can set text height to 0 in the text style in order to specify a</p>
    <p>new height before creating
 text.</p>
    <p>For TrueType
 fonts, the value of text height represents the height of a capital letter plus
 an ascent area. The ascent is
 reserved for accent marks and other marks used in non-English languages. The
 relative portion of text height
 assigned to capital letters and ascent characters is determined by the font
 designer at the time the font is designed; consequently, it varies
 fromfont to font.</p>
    <p>When you apply a
 text height to all text in the In-Place Text Editor, the whole multiline text
 object is scaled, including its width.</p>
