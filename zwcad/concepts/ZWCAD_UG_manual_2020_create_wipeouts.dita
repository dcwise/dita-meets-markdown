  <title>Create Wipeouts</title>
  <shortdesc>Wipeouts are unique entities
 that can help you hide
 areas of your drawing. They display with the cur ent background color, so the details behind
 the wipeout do not display
 or print.</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>Wipeouts are
 similar to other entities â€” you can copy, mirror, array, erase, rotate, and
 scale them, and they can be used in both model
 space and paper
 space.</p>
    <p>If you want to
 print the wipeout entities located in a drawing, you must print to a
 raster-capable printer. Note that in
 some cases you may have unexpected results when printing drawings that contain
 wipeout entities, for example, if printing on colored paper.</p>
