  <title>Dynamic Block Grip Editing Function</title>
  <shortdesc>Dynamic block
 definition must contain at least one parameter. For dynamic block contains
 actions and parameters,
 the grips associated with the points, objects or regions in the block
 definition will be displayed. When you edit a grip, the associated
 action will be triggered, thereby changing the block reference
 display. You can perform manipulations such as stretch, move, flip, rotate,
 array, scale, align and lookup
 by dragging the grips of dynamic blocks. After you select a dynamic block with
 the appropriate parameters and actions, you can select
 the dynamic block
 grip (the grip color is light
 blue by</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>default, it can
 be modified via the <u>GRIPDYNCOLOR</u> system variable) to edit, the grip will display in selected grip color, and then you can
 perform manipulations such as stretch, move, rotate, etc. on the selected dynamic
 block.</p>
