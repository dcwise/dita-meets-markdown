  <title>Link Drawings</title>
  <shortdesc>When you link a
 ZWCAD drawing to another document, the other document contains only a reference to the ZWCAD drawing file, rather than the
 actual drawing. You link data in a saved ZWCAD file so that
 the other programcan find the data and display
 it.</shortdesc>
  <taskbody>
    <context>
      <p>Linking works well when
 you want to include the same ZWCAD data in more
 than one document. When you update the
 data, you need to update it in only one location. The versions that are linked to
 other documents reflect
 the changes automatically.</p>
      <p>Linking a ZWCAD file to another
 document does not increase the file size the way embeddinga ZWCAD object
 does. However, links require more maintenance. To transport the data, you must
 make sure to transfer all
 linked files to the other
 computer.</p>

        <cmd>Open the drawing you want to link.</cmd>
        <info>
          <p>
            <b>NOTE </b>Because a link is a reference
 to a file, you can link only files that are saved to a location on a disk.</p>
        </info>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>In the other program,
 open the document inwhich youwant to include the ZWCAD drawing.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>Choose that program's command for inserting objects.</cmd>
      </step>
      <step>
        <cmd>In MicrosoftÂ®
 Office programs, choose Insert &gt; Object. In the Object dialog box, click the Create From File tab. Specify the name of the drawing file youwant to link.
 Select the Link To File check box, and then click OK. The drawing
 appears in the document, with a link to the original ZWCAD file.</cmd>
